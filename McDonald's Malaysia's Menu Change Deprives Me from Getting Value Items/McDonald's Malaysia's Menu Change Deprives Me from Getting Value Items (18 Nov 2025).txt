McDonald's Malaysia's Menu Change Deprives Me from Getting Value Items
A SERIES OF MR. LI AO's ASYLUM-SEEKING JOURNEL

18 November 2025

===================================

PREFACE

I knew that I ordered plain rice, sometimes with condiments of each priced 1 Malaysian Ringgit, very frequently,  at different McDonald's restaurants in Malaysia. This plain coconut rice, as mentioned earlier in other Asylum-Journey documents, was fixed price even in airports or tourist hotspot areas for which almost every other items were inflated due to their unique location. So, in order to get valuable service and for some other reasons, I ordered only those items at airport McDonald's while I had never ordered even one time of their inflated price items.

For their Sambal sauce, I can see it was cooked with chillis plus some other condiments such as MSG, a flavour enhancer, and salt, etc. to make it tasty. Mixing up this Sambal sauce with a McDonald's-burger-sized coconut rice-ball is economy, only RM4 was enough, and of course -- it was guaranteed up until an event that is documented here had happened.

At mid-term of November, I suddenly noticed that ordering machines in a McDonald's outlet had ordering options of this riceball missing, and after noticing of 2 ordering kiosks both missed this item, I realised that this was most likely a global change of McDonald's Malaysia franchiser, which is the headquarters of this regional presence, as I noticed some other details. So, I believed that McDonald's Malaysia had taken official steps to kick me out of their outlets.

EVENT HAPPENING

The last time I was able to order this super value coconut milk- ball of rice is on 13/11/2025, while I used one of their ordering machines with no issues: it simply approved my order after I presented a payment card on it's POS terminal.for payment. 4 numbers of coconut rice, and potato curry sauce, I ate so satisfied that the taste was excellent and the food's volume filled excellently my thirst. I did knew before then that McDonald's headquarters may be able to see CCTV streaming in real time in many or all of their restaurants including the customer dining area, and I did predicted that they might have already knew of me for ordering this so frequently, and an early assessment even concluded that considering these factors plus the fact to which I believed that almost no customers throughout at least West Malaysia order this item routinely and that the total number of individual customers who order this could be very few, the headquarters would likely to remove this offer with little to no prior notifications,  however that day when I was enjoying my meals, I wasn't be aware that this could happen just so sooner.

It was a rainy afternoon in Cyberjaya, the Silicon Valley implementationof Malaysia. On 15/11/2025, walking in the rain, I stepped in to McDonald's Cyberjaya DT to order this super value meal again -- after the important thing for giving me 7 sachets of ketchup sauce is confirmed that if I order a confirmed certain number of rice, I stepped up before an ordering kiosk. The index of menu shown looked somehow strange, and I realised that the long-standing "Desserts & Slides" went missing for which I used to navigate to for choosing the plain rice. Another ordering machine also showed difference,  and I realised that there was now a "Desserts" menu only! I asked the man who was very friendly to attend me while almost everyone I saw in the kitchen ignored me, he checked the kiosks and then moved in front of the front counter operating the terminal machine -- I had sense in the background that this item might haven't been removed from the McDonald's system for which the terminal should have access. Shortly, I saw "Nasi" on the pixel, character-based screen and I knew that it was possible to order on the counter.

After payment, that man gave me a slip of receipt. I was surprised that he even added a type of item consisting 2 sachets of ketchup for me, priced at RM0.00! I laughed-out-loud, yet this item is listed free of charge but many McDonald's workers are not willing to give this complimentary item to me despite clear requests. I went on to collect my item, and of course with order clearly displayed in their kitchen they need to prepare accordingly.

Rice was inside a take-out bag, and when I asked for ketchup they even said "already inside"! I knwe one possible reason for giving ketchup automatically was because the order included them, but I found later that it had more than 7 to which I had requested and to which the order was listed; the item named "3 ketchup 2pkts" was selected 3 times in this order, as later found on the receipt.

I knew that the missing of this item in only one restaurant is inadequite to judge that McDonald's Malaysia had officially deprived me of getting this item and that because of interests-related reasons this local office had made global changes to remove it, while confirming the same changes in at least another restaurant is needed to give suffice proof, despite it doesn't looked like only that restaurant disabledthe selection as if so, the change would simply be this item missing while the name of tab should stillbe the same; and since I exploited this restaurant that had this changes observed on before by splitting multiple orders of plain rice and sauce into cheao orders and request many sachets of ketchup sauce on each instalments. On 18/11/2025, I saw another restaurant also had the same change, so I concluded that such change affects the Malaysian market which prevents the general public from purchasing this item, and that it was likely that McDonald's Malaysia officially deprived me out of their chains of restaurants.

I had also predicted shortly after realised it might be a global change from the headquarters on the 13th that this local headquarters' intentions was to giving allowance to restaurant managers for rejecting my order requests of this item by leveraging such the absense from the ordering kiosk.

FUTURE OUTCOMES

On 19/11/2025, I was unable to make an order consisting 5 numbers of plain rice and 1 number of potato curry, at McDonald's Puchong Gateway DT, after request. When I was at the restaurant the shift appeared to be changed as those friendly staff went missing. A man wearing glasses actually refused my order citing that the ordering machine didn't have it and the front counter also doesn't have such an item. Judging his appearance and behaviour, and the pitch of his vocals, I can confirm that he deceived me intentionally.
