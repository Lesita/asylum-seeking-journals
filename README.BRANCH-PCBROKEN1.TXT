Information on the PCBROKEN1 Branch
Author: Li Ao
===================================

Recently, the screen of my laptop went completely blind, possibly a result of my falling on the ground, as I carry it with me all the time. Because of this, continuing working on this laptop, which has the authoritative, original version of this Git repository,  which settles on the "master" branch, is unviable despite the screen reader can allow me to perform some simple management works.

In consideration of this, a new branch is hereby created in order for the continuation of this Git repository.
